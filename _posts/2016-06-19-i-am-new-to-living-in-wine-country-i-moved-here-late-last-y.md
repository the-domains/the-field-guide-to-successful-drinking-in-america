I am new to living in wine country. I moved here late last year. Few things I have discovered I quickly realized that the tasting experiences really common for people who live in wine country for years and visit when we so often but I wasn't sure of the proper etiquette. Is it mandatory to buy a bottle? Is it appropriate to tip? How can I find better wines? What does it cost?

First dress appropriately.

This is a great social experience and it helps to look the part.

Second no cologne or perfume. This might seem kind of obvious but as much as you love your perfume, it may ruin the tasting experience for everyone around you.

Be open-minded about what you're going to drink. I had no idea how much I would love old Zin (especially from Dry Creek) because I had reminders of Earnest and Julio wine coolers from the eighties stuck in my head.

Don't flex too much wine knowledge. The job of The Tasting Room staff is to tell you and sell you their wines. They probably know a good bit about the vineyards in the neighborhood but not much about the next valley over.

Know-it-alls are never fun.

Don't pretend that you work with the wine trade if you don't. Industry people are those who make a living with wine not home wine making. Also if you do work in the wine industry act like it if it's a busy Saturday know your place and don't ask for special treatment when they have a full bar.

Enough about that. Go ahead and swallow. It's not all about education. It's a wine tasting bar.

On that note if you're visiting a lot of tasting rooms moderate your intake spitting out wine is perfectly acceptable even if you enjoy it nobody likes drunk tasters.

Dumping is fine. It is not rude. Try wines and find what you like.

If you are going to ask for Reserve wines that are beyond the advertised flight realize that this type of request will increase pressure to purchase wine and will probably have an additional cost associated with it.

Buy wine! That's what you're there for. Some tasting rooms have a policy about lifting the tasting fee if the appropriate amount of wine is purchased. Some require two bottles, others it's a judgment call. If you are traveling by plane and have to fly home vineyards understand and often can accommodate for a smaller purchase.

On that note don't haggle. it's just wine. Either by the wine or don't but don't haggle.

Tipping depends on the situation.

Some places take tips others don't. It's a Tasting Room not a bar. I have found some of my favorite tasting rooms and have joined there are wine clubs. When I stop by for a tasting there's no pressure for me to buy and I always discreetly tip.

Join the wine club. If you enjoy the ones they will ship you 4 to 6 bottles 4 times a year and regularly inform you of discounts and often complimentary tastings.
